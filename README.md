# Income Distribution Over Time
This repo exists to support a project that stemmed from a friendly debate with my father-in-law. I want to understand how income distribution is changing over time. This project will pull Current Population Survey data to graph income distributions.  

After adjusting to a common inflation standard, I use R's GGPLOT2 package to take a density of the distribution, and then take the difference in densities over time. This creates a map of how the US income distribution is changing in 5 year increments.
